      <h2>In my own words</h2>
      <p>Hi there! My name is Cherry ‚Äì I was born in Shanghai, but spent most of my life in Canada üá®üá¶ ‚Äì first Vancouver, then Montreal, and right now I‚Äôm based in Washington, D.C üá∫üá∏. I‚Äôm always thinking about everything AI ü§ñ ‚Äì sometimes about traditional geopolitics, sometimes about the impact of AI on women‚Äôs bodies, on social connections as humans, and sometimes more philosophical questions like the definition of intelligence and creativity ü§î... When I‚Äôm not thinking about AI, I‚Äôm either baking üç∞ or finding the next binge-worthy docu-series on Netflix. I love traveling to new places ‚úàÔ∏è, checking out local grocery stores, and discovering third places ‚òïÔ∏è. Currently, I‚Äôm reading üìö: Remarkably Bright Creatures (Shelby Van Pelt) and Meditations (Marcus Aurelius).</p>
